## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project gets a number that is a multiple of five and will divide it into numbers(5,10,20,50,100) and return them in an array

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

It is a sample to show how we can use the recursion in a function. 
The user will insert the number into the form and will submit it. If the number is not a multiple of 5, an error message will appear on the screen and ask the user to try with another number. If the inserted number is a multiple of 5, the function will calculate and return the result. 

### Prerequisites

Recursion is a process of calling itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.

```
function pow(x, n) {
  return (n == 1) ? x : (x * pow(x, n - 1));
}
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
