## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project gets a number that is a multiple of five and will divide it into numbers(5,10,20,50,100) and return them in an array

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "Concept"></a>

It is a sample to show how we can use the recursion in a function. 
The user will insert the number into the form and will submit it. If the number is not a multiple of 5, an error message will appear on the screen and ask the user to try with another number. If the inserted number is a multiple of 5, the function will calculate and return the result in array

### Quick recap

Recursion is a process of calling itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.

```
function pow(x, n) {
  return (n == 1) ? x : (x * pow(x, n - 1));
}
```
